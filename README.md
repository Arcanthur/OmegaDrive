With hundreds of hours of work, this theme has been in development for nearly a year and it's finally ready for a first release.

- Amiga

SPECIAL FEATURES
-----------------------------------

This theme has support for several color variations for GameBoy Color and GameBoy Advance, as
well as the option to change button and joystick types in some of the arcade systems.  Within each system,
there is a theme.xml you will see the following code as an example:

		<image name="background" extra="true">
			<pos>0 0</pos>
			<size>1 1</size>
			<path>./../art/systembg/arcade (happ).png</path>
		</image>

Under path you will see the background image.  Just open the art folder in the directly specified and you can
change the image to your desired background / option of choice.

BACKGROUND MUSIC
-----------------------------------

If you don't already have the ability to play background music and would like to add it, this script is the best I've tried:

OTHER NOTES
-----------------------------------

***If you get flashing screens***

This is probably the heaviest theme ever created (size wise) so you may need to change your VRAM setting in EmulationStation.
My suggestion is 160mb.
